I am Marcello, italian, living in Amsterdam for 6 years. 
I have been working in Finance for the last 6 years. I do not have a real experience with tech but I have been working a lot with reporting data, mostly with excel and SAP business objects. 
I am really intrigued by data science and its utility and potential so I want to learn about it. Ironhack gave me a good impression from the beginning, and I spoke with some alumni, who were satisfied, and the reviews are good. At the end of the bootcamp I hope to have all the fundamental knowledge to land a junior role in data analytics, also with some luck :D It does not matter the industry to me, but the culture makes it all. I am looking for an easy going and fun work environment, where people can speak up and the company cares about their health and wellness, but at the same time, working hard. Iydo not know how my role would look like but i hope i can match my previous knowledge with the tools given me by Ironhack to find an interesting and challenging role in the field of data analytics.
